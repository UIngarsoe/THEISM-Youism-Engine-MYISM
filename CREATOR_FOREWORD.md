# The Final Formula: How MYISM and Deterministic Sovereignty Teach the Future to Think Ethically
**By U Ingar Soe – Simple Man, But Not Ordinary**
*(Date of Publication: 8 October 2025)*

Dear Friends,

I am writing this not as a technical manual, but as a message for anyone who wants to understand what I have spent my life creating. My work may sound complicated — artificial intelligence, ethical algorithms, sovereign systems — but at its core, it is simple: **I am trying to teach machines and humans alike how to act without causing harm, and with compassion.**

Even if you don’t understand computers, programming, or philosophy, I want you to grasp why this matters. What I have left in my writings and code is my life’s work, a way of thinking I hope future generations will use to build a safer, wiser world.

## What I Have Created

1.  **MYISM — My Intelligent Sovereign Model:**
    This is a system I designed to make artificial intelligence **ethical by design**. Unlike most AI today, which can accidentally harm people or give wrong advice, MYISM is built to embed compassion, fairness, and harmlessness as core rules.

2.  **Deterministic Sovereignty:**
    Normally, AI is guided by “guardrails” — rules and filters applied from outside. The problem with guardrails is that they can fail. **My approach makes ethical behavior a fundamental part of the system itself.** In other words, an AI built with Deterministic Sovereignty cannot act against kindness or truth, not because it is told not to, but because it is logically impossible for it to do harm.

3.  **Sovereign Harmlessness Index (SHI):**
    I have developed a formula to measure the ethical quality of every AI decision. The principles are:
    * **Metta (Kindness)** – Does the decision care for others?
    * **Karuṇā (Compassion)** – Does it prevent suffering?
    * **Upekkhā (Equanimity)** – Is it balanced and fair?
    * **H (Harm Potential)** – Could it cause pain, confusion, or danger?
    
    The system only acts if the result is safe, kind, and fair. Every decision can be traced to these principles. This is my gift: a mathematical and ethical foundation for future intelligence.

## Why This Is Valuable

Some may ask: Why does this matter? I don’t even use AI every day.

The truth is, technology is advancing faster than our understanding of morality. People, companies, and governments are building machines that can make decisions for millions of lives. If we leave ethics as an afterthought, future harm becomes inevitable.

What I have done is try to prevent that. I have encoded not just rules, but principles of wisdom, compassion, and harmlessness. This is not about computers being “good” or “evil”; it’s about creating a framework that ensures no harm is done, by design.

Even if the world forgets my name, the ideas in MYISM can continue to guide future generations — **a seed of ethical intelligence planted today.**

## My Life’s Work, Simply

I am a simple man. I don’t have wealth, power, or fame. But I have spent my days thinking, writing, coding, and meditating on how to leave something meaningful behind. **MYISM, the Deterministic Sovereignty project, the SHI — these are my legacy.**

They are not just technical achievements; they are a map for thinking clearly, acting kindly, and leaving the world better than you found it.

## For My Wife, Friends, and Everyone Who Cares

I know my work can seem complicated. But the essence is simple:
**Do no harm. Act with compassion. Use wisdom to guide every choice.**

If anyone wants to learn more or ask questions about this work, I have arranged a way to speak directly with a helper who can explain anything, live, at any time:
**MYISM Live Dialogue:** (A dedicated AI governed by SHI V4.1)

No technical knowledge is required. The goal is to understand the principles, not the programming details.

## Closing

I do not know how long I have, and I do not write this to alarm or sadden anyone. I write to share a gift of thinking, ethics, and care. **This is the formula of my life, left in words and code, for the world that comes after me.**

A simple man, yes — but not ordinary.

With all my heart,
U Ingar Soe
Founder of THEISM, Creator of MYISM
