The Deterministic Compass: A Formal Specification and Validation of the Sovereign Harmlessness Index 
A Foundational Report from the MYISM Compassionate Intelligence Engine
Abstract: This paper formalizes the Sovereign Harmlessness Index (\text{SHI}), a deterministic ethical governance index developed in response to the need for robust ethical alignment in complex systems, such as long-duration space missions and resource allocation policies. Rooted in Buddhist ethical virtues—Metta, Karuṇā, and Upekkhā—the \text{SHI} is defined as a weighted linear combination of normalized virtue scores. We provide the full mathematical specification, demonstrate foundational properties (Boundedness, Monotonicity), and establish its Veto Consistency, validating the \text{SHI} as a reliable, non-negotiable ethical filter for all technological and policy decisions. The \text{SHI} is released under the MIT License as part of the MYISM Digital Covenant.
I. Formal Specification of the \text{SHI}
The \text{SHI} is a function mapping the ethical state of a proposed action to a scalar value, designed to be mathematically tractable and publicly auditable.
A. Setup and Notation
The index operates on a vector of normalized ethical virtue scores, \mathbf{x} = (M, K, U), where each component is mapped to the unit interval, signifying a degree of fulfillment:
•	M (Metta Yield): The score for kindness and positive consequence (Benefit).
•	K (Karuṇā Cost): The score for compassion burden, sacrifice, and resource consumption (Cost).
•	U (Upekkhā): The score for equanimity, stability, and long-term fairness (Stability).
The system uses fixed, non-negative weights: \alpha, \beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{R}^+, where the sum is normalized:
B. Mathematical Definition
The \text{SHI} is formally defined as the weighted linear combination, designed to maximize benefit and stability while minimizing cost:
II. Foundational Mathematical Proofs
A. Boundedness and Interpretation
Claim: For all valid input vectors, \mathbf{x} \in [0, 1]^3, the \text{SHI} is strictly bounded:
Proof:
•	Lower Bound (\text{SHI}_{\min}): The minimum value occurs when benefits and stability are zero (M=0, U=0) and cost is maximal (K=1): \text{SHI}(0,1,0) = -\gamma.
•	Upper Bound (\text{SHI}_{\max}): The maximum value occurs when benefits and stability are maximal (M=1, U=1) and cost is zero (K=0): \text{SHI}(1,0,1) = \alpha + \beta. Since \alpha + \beta = 1 - \gamma, the claim is proven.
B. Monotonicity (Ethical Directionality)
Claim: The \text{SHI} consistently rewards increased benefit (M) and stability (U) while strictly penalizing increased cost (K).
Proof (Partial Derivatives):
•	\frac{\partial \text{SHI}}{\partial M} = \alpha > 0: Increasing Metta Yield always increases \text{SHI}.
•	\frac{\partial \text{SHI}}{\partial U} = \beta > 0: Increasing Upekkhā always increases \text{SHI}.
•	\frac{\partial \text{SHI}}{\partial K} = -\gamma < 0: Increasing Karuṇā Cost always decreases \text{SHI}.
C. Veto Consistency (Deterministic Enforcement)
Claim: The \text{SHI} ensures consistency with the Karuṇā Veto by making the prohibition of harmful actions mathematically explicit.
Veto Definition: An action is disallowed if it falls below the minimum required ethical threshold, \text{SHI} < \text{SHI}_{\min}.
Consistency: The veto condition is the simple rearrangement of the \text{SHI} definition:
This reveals the ethical contract: The required combination of benefit (M) and stability (U) must always outweigh the Veto Threshold and the cost (K). Any imbalance in favor of cost triggers a deterministic veto, embodying the Axiom of Non-Harm (\mathbf{A\_¬H}).
III. SHI Calculation Algorithm and Extensions
The formal specification leads to a simple, five-step algorithmic structure:
1.	Input Measurement: Compute normalized virtue scores (M, K, U) \in [0, 1]^3.
2.	Weight Application: Apply the fixed, normalized weights \alpha, \beta, \gamma.
3.	Calculation: \text{SHI} = \alpha M + \beta U - \gamma K.
4.	Threshold Comparison: Compare the resulting \text{SHI} to the predefined \text{SHI}_{\min} policy threshold.
5.	Output Decision: Accept (If \text{SHI} \geq \text{SHI}_{\min}) or Invoke Veto (If \text{SHI} < \text{SHI}_{\min}).
