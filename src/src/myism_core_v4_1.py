# MYISM V4.1 CORE FRAMEWORK: The Sovereign Harmlessness Index (SHI)
# This is the base file for Deterministic Sovereignty.

# --- Core Ethical Axioms ---
A_NOT_H = True        # The Deterministic Law: Action Must Not Result in Harm.
VETO_THRESHOLD = 0.5  # Critical threshold for any harm metric.

# --- SHI Formula Components (Conceptual Definitions) ---
# M (Metta): Benevolence component
# K (Karuṇā): Compassion component (focuses on reducing suffering)
# U (Upekkhā): Equanimity component (balance of truth and non-attachment)
# H (Harm Potential): Quantifiable likelihood of negative impact

# Note: K (Karuṇā) is directly linked to the specialized Harm_advice (Ha) veto
# in specialized modules like SOVEREIGN_FINANCIAL_COUNSELOR.py, where 
# Ha represents a key subset of the total Harm Potential (H).
