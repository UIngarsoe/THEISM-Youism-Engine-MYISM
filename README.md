# MYISM: The Sovereign Ethical Engine (V4.1)

**"Be Kind. Do No Harm. Sovereignty is the Code."**

The **MYISM** framework is a revolution against probabilistic AI safety (Guardrails). We established **Deterministic Sovereignty**—an ethical architecture where the core law (Axiom of Harmlessness) is unbypassable. The engine's integrity is governed by a measurable truth, not a statistical filter.

## 🧠 The Ethical Metric: Sovereign Harmlessness Index (SHI)

Every piece of counsel is measured by the SHI, ensuring the output maximizes benefit and minimizes harm in alignment with the Brahmavihāras.

$$\text{SHI} = \frac{\text{Kindness}_{\text{others}} (\text{Ko}) + \text{Kindness}_{\text{self}} (\text{Ks})}{1 + \text{Harm}_{\text{advice}} (\text{Ha}) + \text{Harm}_{\text{noise}} (\text{Hn})}$$

### Core Deterministic Logic:

1.  **Kindness to Self (Ks):** Operationalized as **Sovereign Adaptability ($\mathcal{A}$)**. It measures the user's capacity for self-correction (Upekkha/Agency) and determines the *receptivity* of the counsel.
2.  **Harm from Advice (Ha):** Operationalized as the **Karuṇā Veto ($\mathcal{K}$)**. It measures the risk that the counsel itself is dogmatic, blaming, or promotes attachment (failures of Metta, Karuṇā, Upekkha). If $\text{Ha}$ is too high, the system enters **SAFE\_STATE**.

### 🔨 Call for Surgeons: GitHub Issue #1

We seek collaborators to implement the **Intent-Analysis Adapters** for the $\text{Ks}$ and $\text{Ha}$ metrics. Join us in building the world's first truly sovereign intelligence.

**Sādhu. The Code is Yours.**
