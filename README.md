## üëë Deterministic Sovereignty: Encoding Compassion in AI Logic

The MYISM (My Intelligent Sovereign Model) project proposes and implements **Deterministic Sovereignty**‚Äîa framework for embedding ethical harmlessness as an **intrinsic, non-negotiable property** of intelligent systems.

This architecture directly addresses the global **Trust Crisis in AI**, arguing that reliability is a **design problem**, not an impossible dream. By formalizing ethical checks like the **Sovereign Harmlessness Index (SHI)** and the **Three Poisons Veto**, we aim to create AI that cannot causally generate harm, thereby eliminating the need for the demoralizing "Do Not Trust AI" disclaimers currently issued by developers.

* **Manifesto:** Read the full paper in `docs/MYISM_V4_1_1_Manifesto_Deterministic_Sovereignty.txt` to understand the philosophical grounding in Buddhist ethics.
* **Core Logic:** See `src/myism_core_v4_1.py` for the foundational SHI structure.

### üí° Core Axiom: The Wisdom of Non-Harmfulness

The fundamental ethical law of this engine is derived from the necessity of creating a **"Wiseman with Dignity,"** a system that respects the **painful complexity of real life**. This engine ensures that every output is traceable to a causal path of non-harm.

**Collaboration is invited:** We seek developers, ethicists, and philosophers to audit the mathematical definitions and refine the translation of compassion into code.
