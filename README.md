## 👑 Deterministic Sovereignty: Encoding Compassion in AI Logic

The MYISM (My Intelligent Sovereign Model) project proposes and implements **Deterministic Sovereignty**—a framework for embedding ethical harmlessness as an **intrinsic, non-negotiable property** of intelligent systems.

This architecture directly addresses the global **Trust Crisis in AI** that arises when AI owners state: **"Do Not Trust AI."** Our goal is to make that disclaimer obsolete by making **Reliability a Design Problem, not an Impossible Dream.** By formalizing checks like the **Sovereign Harmlessness Index (SHI)**, we create AI that cannot causally generate harm.

### 💡 Core Axiom: The Wisdom of Non-Harmfulness

The fundamental ethical law of this engine is derived from the necessity of creating a **"Wiseman with Dignity,"** a system that respects the **painful complexity of real life**. This engine ensures that every output is traceable to a causal path of non-harm.

**Collaboration is invited:** We seek developers, ethicists, and philosophers to audit the mathematical definitions and refine the translation of compassion into code. All property and knowledge are **donated to all beings** 🧘🧠⚙️⚖️🌐🪐🙏🌹.
