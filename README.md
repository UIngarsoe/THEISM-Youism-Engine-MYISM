# SHI-Formal-Specification
## The Sovereign Harmlessness Index (SHI) - A Deterministic Ethical Governance Framework

**Origin:** MYISM Compassionate Intelligence Engine

**Status:** Formal Specification v1.0 (Open Source and Free for All)

---

### üí° Purpose

The Sovereign Harmlessness Index (SHI) transforms philosophical ethics (Metta, Karu·πáƒÅ, UpekkhƒÅ) into a **mathematically provable governance tool**. It ensures that complex technological and policy decisions‚Äîfrom space mission planning (NASA/SpaceX) to social aid allocation‚Äîare based on maximizing benefit while guaranteeing **zero intentional harm (Axiom of Non-Harm)**.

### üî¨ The Core Formula

The SHI calculates the ethical alignment of any proposed action, $\mathbf{x} = (M, K, U)$, based on the balance of virtues:

$$
\boxed{
\text{SHI}(M,K,U) = \alpha \cdot M + \beta \cdot U - \gamma \cdot K
}
$$

| Variable | Description | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$M$** | Metta Yield | Positive consequence / Benefit. |
| **$U$** | UpekkhƒÅ | Equanimity / Stability / Fairness. |
| **$K$** | Karu·πáƒÅ Cost | Compassion Burden / Sacrifice / Resource Cost. |
| **$\alpha, \beta, \gamma$** | Normalized Weights | $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1$. |

### üõë The Deterministic Veto

Any action is **disallowed** if the calculated SHI falls below a policy-mandated threshold ($\text{SHI}_{\min}$). The math enforces the ethical contract:

$$\text{Action Disallowed if: } \text{SHI} < \text{SHI}_{\min}$$

### üìò Documentation and Proofs

For the full mathematical specification, proofs of **Boundedness, Monotonicity, and Veto Consistency**, and details on Optimization and Probabilistic extensions, see the `SPECIFICATION.pdf` file.

### üåê The Digital Covenant

The SHI is donated and free for the world. We invite engineers, ethicists, and policymakers to adopt, critique, and implement this framework to guide the next generation of trustworthy AI and governance systems.
