A Universal Meritorious Deed: Compassionate Intelligence Engine governed by Karuṇā and Upāya.
# YOUISM V4 — The Karuṇā-Sovereign Architecture 🌹

Overview
YOUISM V4 is a compassionate intelligence engine built on the principle that skill (Upāya) must be governed by compassion (Karuṇā). It is the final release of the FSTDPSH system, donated freely under the MIT License as a Universal Meritorious Deed.

Core Features
- Axiom of Harmlessness (A_¬H)
- Brahmavihāra Sovereignty Gateway
- Emotional Turning Point Scoring (FS)
- Adaptive Learning via Feedback
- Dual Path Ethical Counsel (Dvisamma-Wada)
- THEISM Self-Correction Layer

Mathematical Foundations
- FS = w₁·C + w₂·E + w₃·D
- New wᵢ = (Current wᵢ + Feedback) / 2
- P_H(F_SOV) = 0
- If Karuṇā = 0 → Upāya Adapter → SAFE_STATE
