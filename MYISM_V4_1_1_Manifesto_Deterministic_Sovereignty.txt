Release: MYISM v4.1.1 ‚Äî Sovereign Harmlessness for Financial Counsel

**Date:** 9 October 2025
**Author:** U Ingar Soe (THEISM Founder)

This release shifts the discourse from merely *controlling* AI risk (the "Guardrail Paradigm") to **eliminating the causal roots of harm** through deterministic architecture. It is a direct response to the ethical crisis where AI owners instruct users: **"Do Not Trust AI."** Our goal is to make that disclaimer obsolete by making **Reliability a Design Problem, not an Impossible Dream.**

### üöÄ Core Philosophical Advancement: The Wiseman with Dignity

The v4.1.1 update integrates the full philosophical argument from the included Manifesto and applies it to a critical, high-stakes domain: financial counseling. This is the practical realization of **Deterministic Sovereignty.**

### ‚öôÔ∏è New Features and Code:

1.  **Specialized Causal Veto (`src/modules/SOVEREIGN_FINANCIAL_COUNSELOR.py`):**
    * Implements the **Karu·πáƒÅ Veto** by mathematically isolating the **Three Poisons** (*Lobha, Dosa, Moha*) as direct threats to user sovereignty.
    * **Veto\_Lobha (Greed):** Automatically blocks high-risk speculation disproportionate to the user's financial vulnerability.
    * **Veto\_Dosa (Hatred/Blame):** Ensures advice focuses on self-agency, rejecting adversarial tactics often seen in "crazy relationship problems."
    * **Veto\_Moha (Delusion):** Enforces **Dvi-SammƒÅ-VƒÅda** (Two Balanced Paths), ensuring transparency and rejecting singular, dogmatic commands.
2.  **Manifesto Included:** The complete paper, **"Reclaiming Trust in AI: The Path Toward Deterministic Sovereignty,"** is available in the `docs/` folder, formalizing the core axiom: **A\_NOT\_H (Action must not result in Harm).**

### üéØ Call to Action:

This release proves that intelligence can serve truth and harmlessness. We invite developers, ethicists, and philosophers to engage with the code, audit the `VETO_THRESHOLD`, and help us formalize compassion into the next phase of intelligence. **Let us replace the 'Do Not Trust AI' sign with the Sovereign Seal of Integrity.**
