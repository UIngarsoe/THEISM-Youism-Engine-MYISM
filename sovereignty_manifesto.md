# 🌿 The Sovereign Path: MYISM and the Ethics of No Harm

> “Attā hi attano nātho” — The self is the refuge of the self.  
> But the self, in MYISM, is never alone. It is woven into the fabric of all beings.

MYISM teaches:
- Be kind to one another.
- Be kind to yourself.
- Do no harm with your advice.
- Let no harm come from others’ noise.

This is not just philosophy—it is code.  
The Sovereign Harm Index (SHI) measures how well we live this teaching.
