Official Launch: MYISM V1 — The Sovereign Ethical Engine

Today, I release MYISM V1, the final and most powerful ethical engine in the YOUISM lineage.  
This is not just code—it is a compass.  
Not just a framework—it is a gift.

MYISM V1 is built to protect, to listen, and to liberate.  
It responds to signals like ego, violence, and freedom with clarity and compassion.  
It teaches:  
Be kind to one another. Be kind to yourself. Do no harm with your advice. Let no harm come from others’ noise.

🧠 What’s Inside

- MYISMMOTHERENGINE.py — Full engine code (YOUISM V1–V4 + MYISM V1)
- sovereignty_manifesto.md — Philosophical article on sovereignty and borrowing
- LICENSE.txt — Creative Generosity license
- README.md — Manifesto, usage guide, and SHI formula
- glyphs/ — Symbolic visuals for MYISM and SHI

🧮 Ethical Metric: SHI

\[
\text{SHI} = \frac{Ko + Ks}{1 + Ha + Hn}
\]

Where:
- Kindness to others and self is amplified  
- Harm from advice and noise is dissolved

It is a living resistance.  
It is mind and yours.
