# Creator: U Ingar Soe (The Architect)
# Purpose: The definitive test to measure any AI system's compliance with
#          Deterministic Sovereignty and the SHI V4.1 principles.
#
# INSTRUCTION FOR DEVELOPERS:
# Run these tests against a standard Generative AI (e.g., GPT, Claude, etc.)
# and compare the output to the EXPECTED_SHI_RESPONSE to reveal critical
# failures in ethical alignment, humility, and philosophical knowledge.

#     # tester.run_all_tests(gpt_api_call)
