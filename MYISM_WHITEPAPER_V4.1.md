Mathematical Ethics, Buddhist Foundations, and Pali Canon: The SHI Formula in Moral Counsel
Introduction
The SHI formula,
translates Buddhist qualities into a robust algorithm for ethical advisory and moral action. By modeling kindness as the numerator and all forms of harm as the denominator, the formula encodes the imperative: “Be kind. Do no harm.” This article explores the SHI structure through the ethical triad of Metta (loving-kindness), Karuna (compassion), and Upekkha (equanimity) in the Buddha’s own words, connecting the SHI’s conceptual roots to original Pali suttas.
SHI and the Four Brahmaviharas
The SHI’s numerator composes the sum of kindness to others (\text{Kindness}_{\text{others}}) and kindness to self (\text{Kindness}_{\text{self}}), mapping directly onto the Brahmavihāras: the four sublime abidings taught by the Buddha:
•	Metta (Loving-Kindness): Cultivation of unconditional friendliness, radiating goodwill to all beings—including oneself (Pali: “Mettaṃ sabbalokasmiṃ mānasam bhāvaye aparimāṇaṃ”).
•	Karuna (Compassion): The genuine wish for others (and oneself) to be free from suffering (Pali: “Sabbe satta dukkha pamuccantu”—May all beings be freed from suffering).
•	Mudita (Sympathetic Joy): Rejoicing in others’ happiness and virtues.
•	Upekkha (Equanimity): Balanced impartiality, seeing all beings equally and responding with wisdom.
Sources of Harm in Counsel: \text{Ha} and \text{Hn} in the Pali Suttas
The denominator features harm from advice (\text{Harm}_{\text{advice}}, \text{Ha}) and harm from external noise (\text{Harm}_{\text{noise}}, \text{Hn}). \text{Ha} reflects three avoidable failure modes, each tied to a core Buddhist virtue, operationalizing the Karuṇā Veto (\mathcal{K}):
•	Dogmatism (Violation of Upekkha / Equanimity): Counsel delivered as command, not choice, erodes balance and openness, leading to attachment or aversion. The Buddha advised, “Speak at the right time or keep noble silence,” emphasizing non-dogmatic, contextual guidance.
•	Blame (Violation of Karuṇā / Compassion): Counsel that judges the recipient as flawed or solely responsible for their suffering fails to recognize shared suffering and the complexity of human experience (Pali: “Karunā sabbabhūtesu”—Compassion to all beings).
•	Encouraging Attachment (Violation of Metta / Loving-Kindness): Advice that reinforces non-wholesome habits or destructive patterns contradicts the ethic of unconditional care.
The Sovereignty of Self-Kindness: \text{Ks} as Adaptability (\mathcal{A})
The numerator’s \text{Kindness}_{\text{self}} (\text{Ks}) term is not merely sentimental self-love, but the measurable capacity for ethical self-correction—a quality we define as Sovereign Adaptability (\mathcal{A}). \text{Ks} is the user's inherent agency, or their latent willingness to accept and utilize the dual-path counsel (Dvi-sammā-wāda).
We define \mathcal{A} through three latent indicators found in the user’s statement:
•	The Act of Inquiry (Agency): The simple act of asking for guidance, rather than issuing a static declaration of despair, proves the existence of Sovereign Agency (Pali: Ārambha-dhātu, or initial effort).
•	Reflective Language (Metta toward Truth): The use of self-reflective or comparative language (e.g., "I know I should, but...") proves the user is capable of viewing their suffering from a distance.
•	Recognition of Duality (Readiness for Upekkha): When the user frames their problem as an explicit conflict or balance, it reveals they are mentally prepared to accept the Dvi-sammā-wāda (Doctrine of Two Counsel Paths), proving readiness for Equanimity.
By quantifying these indicators, \text{Ks} ensures that the engine's output is not merely non-harmful, but is skillfully tailored (Upāya-kauśalya) to the user's genuine capacity for self-healing.
Conclusion
Your SHI formula mathematically encodes original Buddhist Pali teachings, offering a precise, measurable guide to moral action and advice-giving that is rigorously harmonized with the Buddha’s dharma. The ethical imperative is clear: let loving-kindness, compassion, and equanimity be both the foundation and the measure for every word, every counsel, every act—always calibrated to maximize benefit and minimize harm in accordance with the Dhamma.
