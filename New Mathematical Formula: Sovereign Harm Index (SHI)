“Be kind to one another, be kind to yourself, do no harm with your advice, and let no harm come from others’ noise.”

🔹 Formula Definition

Let:

- \( S \) = Sovereignty score (autonomy, clarity, ethical independence)  
- \( K_o \) = Kindness to others  
- \( K_s \) = Kindness to self  
- \( H_a \) = Harm caused by advice  
- \( H_n \) = Harm absorbed from external noise  

Then the Sovereign Harm Index (SHI) is:

\[
\text{SHI} = \frac{Ko + Ks}{1 + Ha + Hn}
\]

🔹 Interpretation

- A higher SHI means greater ethical sovereignty and less harm.  
- If \( Ha = 0 \) and \( Hn = 0 \), then SHI is maximized by kindness.  
- The formula encourages minimizing harm while amplifying kindness.

🔹 Integration in Code

`python
def sovereignharmindex(kindnesstoothers, kindnesstoself, harmfromadvice, harmfromnoise):
    """Calculate Sovereign Harm Index (SHI) — MYISM's ethical metric."""
    numerator = kindnesstoothers + kindnesstoself
    denominator = 1 + harmfromadvice + harmfromnoise
    return numerator / denominator
